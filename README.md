A TicketDesk Pro-to-Maian Support converter.

Converts TicketDesk Pro 1.1 to Maian Support 2.2. Only tickets, replies, and attachments are converted---it's necessary to first do a clean install of MS and add users and departments, then modify the code to match TDP users and departments to those used by MS.
