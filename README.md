A TicketDesk Pro-to-Maian Support converter.

Converts TicketDesk Pro 1.1 to Maian Support 2.1. Only tickets, replies, and attachments are converted---it's necessary to first do a clean install of MS and add users and departments, then modify the code to match TDP users and departments to those used by MS.

There are two sections where the database configuration details need to be added. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. PRACTICE SAFE BACKUPS.
